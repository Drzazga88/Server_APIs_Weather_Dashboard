# Server_APIs_Weather_Dashboard

## Description
This app is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Acceptance criteria
- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed

- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity

- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Current issues
- Search history updated only after page refresh
- 5-days forecast is not working yet.
